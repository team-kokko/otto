We can improve this model by engineering features, merging them unto items and users, and training a reranker model (such as XGB) to choose our final 20. Furthermore to tune and improve this notebook, we should build a local CV scheme to experiment new logic and/or models.\n","\n","UPDATE: I published a notebook to compute validation score [here][10] using Radek's scheme described [here][11].\n","\n","Note in this competition, a \"session\" actually means a unique \"user\". So our task is to predict what each of the `1,671,803` test \"users\" (i.e. \"sessions\") will do in the future. For each test \"user\" (i.e. \"session\") we must predict what they will `click`, `cart`, and `order` during the remainder of the week long test period.\n","\n","### Step 1 - Generate Candidates\n","For each test user, we generate possible choices, i.e. candidates. In this notebook, we generate candidates from 5 sources:\n","* User history of clicks, carts, orders\n","* Most popular 20 clicks, carts, orders during test week\n","* Co-visitation matrix of click/cart/order to cart/order with type weighting\n","* Co-visitation matrix of cart/order to cart/order called buy2buy\n","* Co-visitation matrix of click/cart/order to clicks with time weighting\n","\n","### Step 2 - ReRank and Choose 20\n","Given the list of candidates, we must select 20 to be our predictions. In this notebook, we do this with a set of handcrafted rules. We can improve our predictions by training an XGBoost model to select for us. Our handcrafted rules give priority to:\n","* Most recent previously visited items\n","* Items previously visited multiple times\n","* Items previously in cart or order\n","* Co-visitation matrix of cart/order to cart/order\n","* Current popular items\n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdeotte/Kaggle_Images/main/Nov-2022/c_r_model.png)\n","  \n","# Credits\n","We thank many Kagglers who have shared ideas.
